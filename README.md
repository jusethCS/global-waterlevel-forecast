# GLOBAL WATER LEVEL FORECAST

A web platform providing water level forecasts for over 20,000 stations worldwide, leveraging the GEOGLOWS ECMWF Streamflow Service (GESS) with corrections based on satellite-derived water levels from Hydroweb.

## Structure

The platform is organized into three main components:

- **tasks**  
  Includes scripts for preprocessing and postprocessing GEOGLOWS model data, as well as applying corrections based on water level observations from Hydroweb. Developed in Python, SQL, and Bash.

- **backend**  
  Provides an API for data queries, generation of graphs, and analytical functionalities required by the platform. Developed using Django.

- **frontend**  
  Offers the graphical user interface for interacting with the platform. Developed using Angular.
